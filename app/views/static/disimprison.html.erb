    <p>
      In the age of collaboration why is so much important knowledge imprisoned in Word documents?
      Liberate your expert knowledge and promote reproducibility of experimental results.
      By becoming a contributor to ScientificProtocols.org you are using the flexibility of markdown
      and the power of the GitHub platform to help build the most comprehensive, traceable, peer reviewed
      and thorough archive of scientific protocols ever assembled. This archive is entirely open source
      and without commercial interest of any kind.

    <h1 class="text-center">Why GitHub?</h1>
    <p>
      GitHub is a web-based hosting service for projects that use the Git revision
      control system. GitHub is the logical starting point for an archive of protocols
      thanks to its advanced collaboration features and its key involvement in the

      Here's a few ways GitHub makes a fantastic foundation for the ScientificProtocols.org site.

        <h4 class="media-heading">Version Control</h4>
        GitHub provides version control. Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that
        you can recall specific versions later. Any type of file on a computer can be placed under version control.
        In addition to being able to track the history of changes to a file using a version control
        system means that if you make a mistake or lose files, you can recover them easily.

      <div class="media-body">
        <h4 class="media-heading">Forking</h4>
        GitHub provides protocol forking. A fork is a copy of a protocol. Forking a protocol allows you to
        freely experiment with changes without affecting the original protocol. Most commonly, forks are used to either
        propose changes to someone else's protocol or to use someone else's protocol as a starting point for your own idea.

        <h4 class="media-heading">Collaboration</h4>
        GitHub provides excellent collaboration features. These features allow you peer review protocols,
        track protocol changes and follow your favorite protocol authors.
