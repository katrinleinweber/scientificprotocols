### ScientificProtocols.org - GitHub for Scientific Protocols
The core codebase for the [ScientificProtocols.org](https://www.scientificprotocols.org) website. The purpose of this site is to provide a free
and easy way for scientists to publish and collaborate on scientific protocols. By sharing scientific protocols we hope to encourage transparency in
research and promote reproducibility of published results. [ScientificProtocols.org](https://www.scientificprotocols.org)
is part of the [Reproducibility Initiative](http://validation.scienceexchange.com/#/reproducibility-initiative).

The site is heavily focused on GitHub integration. GitHub provides a rock solid foundation for scientific collaboration. Every protocol
created on the [ScientificProtocols.org](https://www.scientificprotocols.org) website is also a [GitHub Gist](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists).

The core website codebase has been made open source ([MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)) as part of the [Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint](http://mozillascience.org/).

Thank you to [Science Exchange](https://www.scienceexchange.com) for their support and input on the site and for their general support
of all initiatives dedicated to making researchers lives easier and improving the quality of scientific research.
