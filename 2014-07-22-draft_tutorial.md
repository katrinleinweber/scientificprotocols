- why do version control 
- talking people out of Word
- make the transition easy (new tool has to be 3x easier than the tool you're already using)

-slider bar to jog your memory through changes (visual approach to differencing) - time machine model

- tutorial feature (Dani's idea)
	-starting from word, pdf etc.
	-pull from github tutorial materials

-see keynote talk from scipy on this topic*

- template for gist format for protocols (implicit right now)
