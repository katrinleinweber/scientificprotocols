# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        page_title: 'Scientific Protocols Wiki'
        page_content_html: "Welcome to the Scientific Protocols wiki. The purpose of this wiki is to explain the features offered by
        the site and how to use those features.
        <h2 id='getting-started'>Getting started</h2>
        <h4>GitHub</h4>
        <p>The first thing you need to do in order to use all of the features of the site is to create a free GitHub account. Please read
        the <a href='/wiki_github'>GitHub page</a> to learn more about why a free GitHub account is required and how to go about
        creating one.</p>
        <h4>Protocol management</h4>
        <p>Once you're up an running with your GitHub account we'll cover the basics of protocol management such as protocol creation and editing.
        Please read the <a href='/wiki_protocol_management'>protocol management page</a> to learn more about basic protocol management.</p>
        <h2 id='advanced-features'>Advanced features</h2>
        <h4>Forking</h4>
        <p>Now that you're more familiar with the site fundamentals let's cover some more advanced concepts. The first advanced concept to
        discuss is protocol forking. Forking is the process of using another protocol as the starting point of your own new protocol.
        Please read the <a href='/wiki_forking'>forking page</a> to learn more about how to fork protocols and why it's useful.</p>
        <h4>Markdown</h4>
        <p>Another advanced feature to discuss is markdown. The purpose of markdown is to allow you to write using an easy-to-read,
        easy-to-write plain text format that converts to structurally valid HTML. If you're unfamiliar with writing markdown it can
        be confusing at first glance but in reality it's very quick to learn. Please read the
        <a href='https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/' target='_blank'>markdown page</a>
        to learn more about markdown.</p>
        <h4>Revisions</h4>
        <p>Thanks to GitHub all changes to protocols on the site are recorded. It's easy to view changes to a protocol over time and
        to understand what, when and why protocol changes are made. Please read the <a href='/wiki_revisions'>revisions page</a> to
        learn more about protocol revisions.</p>
        <h4>Starring</h4>
        <p>Protocol starring is simply a way of bookmarking protocols so that you easily refer to them in the future. Please read
        the <a href='/wiki_starring'>starring page</a> to learn more about protocol starring.</p>
        <h2 id='external-integration'>External integration</h2>
        <p>Scientific Protocols believes in true open access and encourages you to share protocols outside of our site. There are two
        main ways to easily use our protocols on another site. The two ways are protocol embedding and via the API.</p>
        <h4>Embedding protocols</h4>
        <p>If you have your own site and you'd like to display your protocol on it you can embed the protocol. Embedding is a simple
        copy and paste process but a rudimentary knowledge of HTML is required. Please read the <a href='/wiki_embedding'>embedding page</a>
        to learn more about embedding protocols.</p>
        <h4>The Scientific Protocols API</h4>
        <p>Scientific Protocols exposes all of its protocol data via an application programming interface (API). This allows you to
        programmatically use all of our data. Basic computer programming knowledge is required to work with the API. To read more about
        the API please see the <a href='/api_v1'>API page</a>.</p>
        <h2 id='contact-us'>Contact us</h2>
        If you're still unable to find the information you're looking for or have additional enquiries of any kind please feel free to
        <a href='/contact'>contact us</a>."
      wiki_github:
        page_title: 'GitHub'
        page_content_html: "<p>Scientific Protocols is built on top of the GitHub platform. This allows the site to have advanced features.
        In order to use features of GitHub you need to have a free GitHub account.</p>
        <h4>What is GitHub?</h4>
        <p>GitHub is a web-based hosting service for projects that use the Git revision control system.
        <a href='https://github.com/about'>Learn more about GitHub</a>.</p>
        <h4>Creating a GitHub account</h4>
        <p>If you already have a GitHub account you simply need to authorize Scientific Protocols to have access to it.
        Authorization will occur when you click either sign in or sign up.</p> %{image_authorize}
        <p>If you do not have a GitHub account you can easily create one. Click sign in or sign up on the Scientific Protocols site.
        When presented with the GitHub login page click the sign up button.</p> %{image_github_signup}
        <p>Complete the GitHub signup process. You will be redirected to the Scientific Protocols site upon completion.
        Now that you have successfully signed up you're ready to <a href='/wiki_protocol_management'>create a protocol</a>.</p>"
      wiki_forking:
        page_title: 'Forking'
        page_content_html: "<p>Forking might sound exotic and strange but it is actually a simple yet powerful concept.
        Forking is essentially copying an existing protocol and using it as a starting point for your own. The reason this is
        powerful is that you retain all of the revision history from the original protocol giving an unbroken chain of revisions
        reaching all the way back to the time of the original protocols creation. As a tool for ensuring the quality and reliability of protocols
        forking is invaluable.</p>
        <h4>How to fork a protocol</h4>
        <p>To fork a protocol click the fork button found in the right column of options when
        viewing the protocol. You can only fork a protocol authored by someone else. You cannot fork a protocol you have created.</p>
        %{image_fork_protocol_button}
        <h4>Forking on GitHub</h4>
        <p>Forking is a GitHub concept. To learn more about how it is applied outside of the Scientific Protocols website please
        read the <a href='https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/' target='_blank'>GitHub forking page</a>.</p>"
      wiki_protocol_management:
        page_title: 'Protocol Management'
        page_content_html: "<h4>Protocol creation</h4>
        <p>Click the new protocol button to create a protocol. If you have not yet signed in you will be prompted to sign in.</p> %{image_new_protocol_button}
        <p>Fill out the title and description of the protocol.</p> %{image_protocol_form}
        <p>The description field should contain the main body of the protocol. It is pre-populated with recommended sections to complete. These
        sections are only a guide. Feel free to structure your protocol in a way that works for you. You can preview your progress by
        clicking the preview button. This will show you your protocol as it will appear when published. Click the preview button again
        to return to the protocol editing mode.</p>
        <h5>Writing markdown</h5>
        <p>The description field should be written in markdown. The purpose of markdown is to allow you to write using
        an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format that converts to structurally valid HTML.

        <h5>Adding images to protocols</h5>
        <p>You can add an image to your protocol by linking to it. You can link to any image publicly available on the internet.
        If your image is stored locally on your computer we recommend <a href='http://imgur.com/' target='_blank'>Imgur</a>.
        <a href='http://imgur.com' target='_blank'>Imgur</a> is free to use. Simply create an account, upload your image and
        then copy the direct link to that image.</p> %{image_imgur}
        <p>Once you have copied the direct link to the image click the image button on the protocol form and paste the
        copied link into the text box that pops up.</p>
        %{image_image_button}<br>
        %{image_image_popup}
        <h5>Tagging protocols</h5>
        <p>You may select up to three tags that categorize your protocol. Search for an existing tag by typing some or all of
        the letters that make up the tag. If your tag doesn't exist yet you can create it by typing the full tag name and pressing
        tab.</p>
        %{image_tags}
        <h5>Saving your protocol</h5>
        <p>You can save the progress of your protocol by clicking the save button. The first time you save a protocol it will be
        saved in a draft state. This allows you to save the progress of your protocol as you go. When you are satisfied that your
        protocol is complete you can publish it. This will make the protocol publicly available. See the protocol publishing section
        for more details of the publishing process.</p>
        <h4>Protocol editing</h4>
        <p>Editing a protocol is much the same as creating one. You can only edit protocols that you are the author of. If you
        would like to use a protocol that another researcher has authored as the template for your protocol you can fork
        the protocol. See the <a href='/wiki_forking'>forking page</a> for more information on protocol forking. To edit a protocol
        simply view the protocol and click the edit button.</p>
        %{image_edit_protocol_button}
        <h4>Protocol publishing</h4>
        <p>When a protocol is first created it is in a draft state. When you're satisfied the protocol is ready to be publicly
        visible you can publish it. If for any reason you wish to take the protocol down temporarily you can also unpublish the
        protocol. The publish/unpublish button is found in the right column of options when viewing the protocol. Only the protocol
        author will see these buttons.</p>
        %{image_publish_protocol_button}
        <h4>Protocol deletion</h4>
        <p>If you wish to delete a protocol you can do so by clicking the delete button found in the right column of options when
        viewing the protocol. Only the author of a protocol can delete it. Once you have deleted a protocol it cannot be recovered.</p>

        page_content_html: "<p>Starring a protocol is simply a way of bookmarking a protocol so that you can easily find it later. To star
        a protocol click the star button found in the right column of options when viewing the protocol. Once starred you can unstar
        the protocol if you no longer wish to track it.</p>
        %{image_star_protocol_button}
        <p>To view protocols you have starred click the account menu item and select the starred tab on the account page.</p>

        <a href='http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control' target='_blank'>Git version control system</a>
        every change made to a protocol is tracked and can be viewed. To view changes to a protocol click the revisions button
        found in the right column of options when viewing the protocol.</p>
        %{image_revisions_button}
        <h4>Interpreting revisions</h4>
        <p>Each time a change to a protocol occurs it is stored as a revision. A revision includes a date/time stamp that the
        change occurred and a summary of the number of additions and deletions that happened as part of the change.</p>
        %{image_revisions}
        <p>In addition to the revision summary a detailed breakdown of the changes is displayed. The red line shows you
        what the line contained before the change was made. The green line indicates what the new contents are.
        If there is only red it means the line is now deleted. If there is only green it means the line
        is new and has just been added.</p>
        <p>It's also possible to view the entire protocol as it was at the moment a particular revision was made.
        In other words you can see snapshots of entire protocols throughout their lifetime rather than just the
        changes. To do this simply click the view gist button next to the revision you wish to view.</p>

        page_title: 'Embedding'
        page_content_html: "<p>If you would like to display a protocol on your website you can achieve this by embedding the protocol.</p>
        <h4>What is embedding?</h4>
        <p>Embedding is the process of adding HTML from an external source to your web page. This is typically achieved by adding
        a snippet of JavaScript to your page that makes a call to an external web service to obtain the HTML. Typical examples of
        embedding include social media buttons such as Facebook and Twitter.</p>
        <h4>How to embed your protocol</h4>
        <p>In order to embed a protocol you need to be able to change the HTML of the page you wish to embed the protocol in.
        Content management systems (CMS) such as WordPress allow you to do this easily. If you don't use a CMS you'll need
        some basic knowledge of HTML and access to the codebase for the page you want to add the protocol to.
        To embed the protocol copy the embed url script from the protocol by clicking the copy to clipboard button.</p>
        %{image_embed_protocol_button}
        <p>Once copied paste the script tags into the body of the HTML page. If successful you will see the protocol in
        its entirety on the page.</p>

        <p>Thanks to Scientific Protocols integration with
        <a href='https://zenodo.org/about' target='_blank'>Zenodo</a> when you publish your protocol you will automatically receive a DOI.
        The DOI will be added as a markdown compatible button at the end of your protocol.</p>
        %{image_doi_button}
        <p>Because the button is part of your protocols markdown you can move it to a different location
        in your protocol or remove it entirely if you want to. Simply edit your protocol and move the buttons markdown
